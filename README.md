# DISEASE-PREDICTION
💡 Chronic Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease based on patient data. The primary objective is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and diagnosis, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

🔍 Problem Statement
Chronic diseases are long-lasting conditions that often progress slowly and may not show symptoms in early stages. Early prediction using data-driven models can lead to timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Streamlit / Flask (optional for deployment)

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available medical datasets containing features such as age, gender, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, etc. Each record is labeled with the presence or absence of a chronic condition.

✅ Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training using algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Optional: Web app interface for user input and prediction

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo

Install required packages

Run the notebook or script

(Optional) Launch the app using Streamlit or Flask

🔮 Future Scope
Integration with real-time wearable data

Multi-disease prediction in a single model

Improved accuracy using deep learning
